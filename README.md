# Forecasting Project Cost Variance and Enhancing Success Prediction

## Overview
This capstone project undertaken at the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) aimed to forecast project cost variance and enhance success prediction using advanced data analytics techniques. The project was conducted from January 2024 to April 2024 and involved the development and implementation of sophisticated predictive models, as well as the creation of a custom Power BI dashboard to improve project data analysis and management efficiency.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this capstone project were:
- To develop predictive models that accurately forecast project cost variance.
- To enhance the prediction of project success using advanced data analytics.
- To create a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time project data analysis.
- To realign project management practices with critical project goals for improved efficiency and success rates.

## Methodology
The project followed a structured data science approach:
- **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gathered historical project data from CRA databases, performed cleaning operations, and normalized data structures for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identified key factors influencing cost variance through statistical analysis and visualization of historical patterns.
- **Feature Selection**: Applied correlation analysis and feature importance techniques to determine the most significant variables for predicting cost variance.
- **Model Development**: Evaluated multiple algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and linear regression models to identify the most effective approach.
- **Model Validation**: Implemented k-fold cross-validation to ensure model reliability and prevent overfitting to historical data.
- **Dashboard Design**: Utilized user-centered design principles to create intuitive visualizations that highlight critical insights for decision-makers.

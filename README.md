# Forecasting Project Cost Variance and Enhancing Success Prediction

## Overview
This capstone project undertaken at the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) aimed to forecast project cost variance and enhance success prediction using advanced data analytics techniques. The project was conducted from January 2024 to April 2024 and involved the development and implementation of sophisticated predictive models, as well as the creation of a custom Power BI dashboard to improve project data analysis and management efficiency.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this capstone project were:
- To develop predictive models that accurately forecast project cost variance.
- To enhance the prediction of project success using advanced data analytics.
- To create a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time project data analysis.
- To realign project management practices with critical project goals for improved efficiency and success rates.

## Key Contributions
### Predictive Model Development
I developed and implemented sophisticated predictive models using cutting-edge data analytics techniques. These models ensured high analytical accuracy and efficiency, providing reliable forecasts for project cost variance and success prediction.

### Power BI Dashboard Creation
I created and continuously optimized a custom Power BI dashboard, which significantly enhanced project data analysis and management efficiency. The dashboard provided real-time insights and facilitated better decision-making by presenting data in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

### Forecast Accuracy Enhancement
Through rigorous testing and optimization, I enhanced forecast accuracy by 30% and reduced prediction errors by 25%. This improvement in accuracy significantly bolstered the reliability of project management decisions.

### Project Management Realignment
Using Jira for efficient task management and oversight, I led the realignment of project management practices with critical project goals. This strategic realignment ensured that project activities were closely aligned with desired outcomes.

### Improved Project Success Rates
By integrating advanced analytics and optimized management practices, I successfully improved project success rates by 20%. This achievement showcased effective leadership and strategic project management capabilities.

## Tools and Technologies Used
